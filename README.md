Designing Data-Intensive Applications
=====================================

Literature References
---------------------

This repository accompanies the book [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](http://dataintensive.net/)
by [Martin Kleppmann](https://www.google.co.uk/maps), published by
[O'Reilly Media](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032175.do).

The book contains a large number of references to further reading material for anyone who wants to
go into more depth, ranging from books and research papers to blog posts, bug reports and tweets.
Many of the references are freely available online.

The purpose of this repository is to maintain up-to-date links to the full text of online resources,
where available. If you are reading the print edition, you may find it quicker than using a search
engine to find the material. If you are reading an ebook edition, we have included links directly in
the ebook, but unfortunately links tend to break frequently due to the nature of the web.

If you find a broken link or any error in the references, please submit a pull request to fix it.
For academic papers, you can search for the title in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/)
to find open-access PDF files.

Maps
----

As an additional special touch, the book has a graphical table of contents for each chapter,
[drawn in the style of a geographic map](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/drawing-a-map-of-distributed-data-systems).
Each chapter is represented by an island in the sea of distributed data. We have also assembled
the archipelago into a poster which you can download here:

* [Poster of maps in PDF format](https://github.com/ept/ddia-references/blob/master/ddia-poster.pdf)
* [Poster of maps in JPEG format](https://github.com/ept/ddia-references/blob/master/ddia-poster.jpg)
